# OLDDIGIBOX DEVELOPER DOCUMENTS
The developer documents for OldDigibox. We use these to show our developers (new & existing) how to make use of our code and resources.

If you're an OldDigibox developer and looking for these documents, we have two versions of each document available: MD, which is viewable on GitHub, and DOCX, which you can download and view
on Word.
